## Version 0.1.0

While version 0.1.0 sounds like a small number, this project is out there since quite some years already
and actively used by Contour Terminal.

The biggest movements lately are major performance improvements in accessing Unicode properties,
fixing bugs as usual, and apart from being a modern C++ Unicode library, we've now also added
a command line tool to query Unicode properties in the hope it'll be useful to you.
